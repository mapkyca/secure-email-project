Oxford Brookes University Secure Email Project: Secure Email Proxy
==================================================================

This is the source code for the OBU Secure Email Proxy, which I wrote
many many many moons ago (2002/2003). It is a local PGP encryption proxy that adds 
PGP support and key management to *any* email client.

This was quite a fun project to hack on (for one, I got to pretend to be 
a student again for a year or so). 

This is the code as it was when I left the project, c2003. I've been told
it was taken on and hacked on since then, but I've not got access to the code 
and the original project site is no more. 

Since code wants to be free, here is the original code from my own backups. If you 
have a more recent version then please give me a nudge/send a pull request.

The code is copyright 2002 The Oxford Brookes University, and released under
the GPL.

Suggested improvements
----------------------

* Newer cryptographic algorithms
* Brush up the interface
* S/MIME support (bonus points if you could automate the painful certificate retrieval process)

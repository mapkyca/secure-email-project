  <p>The secure email proxy is designed to provide a user friendly way of encrypting
  and signing email messages in a corporate setting where existing users are either
  unable or unwilling to dramatically change existing working habits.</p>

  <p>The use of the internet has grown considerably in the last few years and is
  now seen and used as quick and convenient means of communication amongst individuals,
  organisations and businesses. </p>

  <p>However, only recently, many people have questioned the security aspects of
  internet usage, particularly in the areas of banking and on-line purchasing.
  One of the keys to the success of such areas is the ability to persuade and
  prove to people, that they are 'safe to use'. </p>

  <p>With a move to doing more on-line, not just here at Brookes but within the
  higher education sector in the UK, then security issues need to be addressed
  and research projects, such as this are one way of doing so. </p>

    <p>Provides a protocol representing a generic proxy internal command structure.</p>
    <p>The package provides a set of commands and responses that give the proxy server pipes
       an abstract protocol independent way of watching the mail exchange and performing actions
       in response to key events.</p>
    <p>It is up to the specific protocol handler to convert to and from IPTP and the native
       mail protocol, throwing a {@link core.exceptions.NoMappingPossibleException NoMappingPossibleException} if
       no safe mapping is possible.</p>
    <p>You may extend the command classes if you wish, but you must not change the core functionality.</p>

 * You must encode and decode contained packets EXPLICETLY using the appropriate decrypt / encrypt methods and provide the appropriate session keys.</p>

 * are MEANINGLESS! It is not possible to accurately calculate the size of the body before it is encoded. Therefore this class'
 * encodePacket() method recalculates the header length information.

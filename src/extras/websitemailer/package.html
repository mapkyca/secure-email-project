<h1>OpenPGP Webpage Email Applet.</h1>
<p>The webpage email applet is an applet you can place on a webpage to allow visitors 
  to email you securely.</p>
<p>The applet allows a user to type an email on a web page, then when the user 
  hits the send button the apllet will encrypt the email (using your public key 
  file) on the server before sending it to an address which you provide in config.</p>
<p>The applet uses much of the same code as the Email Proxy and serves as a quick 
  example of some of the other applications that the code can be used for.</p>

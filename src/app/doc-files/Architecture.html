<h2><a name="emailproxyoverview"></a>Email Proxy Overview</h2>
<p>Instead of using plugins for differing email clients the email proxy sits on 
  the client machine between the email client and email server and performs the 
  necessary encryption, decryption, signing, authorisation and key management 
  depending on how it is configured.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ep-1.jpg" width="335" height="203"></p>
<p align="left">The users email client is set to point to the email proxy, which 
  will in turn point to a conventional POP3 and SMTP server (currently we are 
  not proxying IMAP) and a public Key server for the users organisation. </p>
<p align="left">When the user wishes to send an email they merely write the email 
  as normal and press the send button. This email is sent to the proxy which examines 
  the message and extracts the recipients email address. The proxy then automatically 
  retrieves the recipients public key from the key server and uses that to encrypt 
  the message. Optionally the user can set up the proxy to digitally sign all 
  their email using their private key. </p>
<p align="left">Receiving email works in a similar manner. The recipients private 
  key is used to decrypt the email and the email checked for a digital signature. 
  If there is a signature, the senders public key is retrieved from the public 
  key server and used to validate the message.</p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="programarchitecture"></a>Program Architecture</h2>
<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>The Email Proxy consists of the following main sections:</p>
<p><b><u>High Level</u></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>User Interface</b> - A wrapper around the API that provides a user friendly 
    way of controlling and configuring the proxy. UI dialogs will be created by 
    various other parts of the Email Proxy system. The design of the UI will change 
    based on user feedback.</li>
  <li><b>Email Pipes</b> - These represent the core functionality of the Email 
    Proxy. They handle mail transport between the email client and the email server 
    and call on the cryptography, signing and key handling API where appropriate. 
    The email pipes call on UI elements as part of their operation - error messages, 
    dialog boxes etc...</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Low Level</u></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Email protocol handlers</b> - Provide support for various email protocols 
    and abstract them to a common internal language. This allows the email pipes 
    to look for key events during email transfer and to catch errors. See the 
    <i>core.protocolhandlers</i> and <i>core.iptp</i> packages for more details.</li>
  <li><b>Key handlers </b>- The key handler API. Provides a common interface for 
    retrieving key material from a number of different sources. See the <i>core.keyhandlers</i> 
    package for more details.</li>
  <li><b>Algorithm handlers</b> - The cryptography API. Currently only OpenPGP 
    is support (and realistically this is all that is likely to be needed). See 
    the <i>core.algorithmhandlers</i> package for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p>The high level sections make up the application that controls the low level 
  sections. It should be a fairly simple matter to implement other applications 
  using the low level API (with hopefully only a minumum of code refinement); 
  for example, a multi-user proxy or a plugin for a webmail system. </p>
<h3><a name="emailpipes"></a>Email Pipes</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="ep-2.jpg" width="550" height="183"></p>
<p>There are two email pipes in the proxy, one handling outgoing messages and 
  another handling incoming messages. </p>
<p>Each pipe is constructed out of a number of objects that will act in turn on 
  a message, for example objects to encrypt and sign a message (in the case of 
  the outgoing pipe) or to decrypt and verify a message (in the case of the incoming 
  pipe).</p>
<p>At either end of the pipe is an object that converts to an from the email protocol 
  (SMTP, POP3 etc) and an internal protocol. This internal protocol provides an 
  abstract way to watch for key events in the email exchange as well as a protocol 
  independent way to catch errors.</p>
<p>Each pipe runs concurrently on its own thread. Once started the pipe listens 
  on a given port for the email client to begin a transaction.</p>
<p>For most of the time, commands from the client are simply relayed to the server 
  and the response relayed back. Certain events however require the proxy take 
  special action. </p>
<p>Some actions require that the email client and email server be &quot;decoupled&quot; 
  until some later point in the exchange, this means that in certain cases (for 
  example when the email client begins sending an email) the email proxy pretends 
  to be the email server and &quot;fakes&quot; an exchange before performing some 
  processing and sending the final result to the email server.</p>
<p>Another place where the exchange is decoupled is during the initial SMTP-AUTH 
  login.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram showing the interaction between email client, proxy and server 
  during a typical outgoing mail exchange...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ep-3.gif"></p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="algorithmhandlers"></a>Algorithm handlers</h4>
<p align="left">An algorithm handler represents the core functionality of the 
  Secure Email Proxy and contains all the cryptographic routines. Currently there 
  is only an algorithm handler available for OpenPGP.</p>
<p align="left"> The OpenPGP handler is passed a list of key sources and passphrases 
  together with an email. This is processed and the result returned. </p>
<p align="left">When email is sent through the proxy, it is intercepted and constructed 
  into an Email object. This, in turn, is passed to the algorithm handler.</p>
<p align="left">The handler examines the email and extracts the recipient addresses 
  (and sender address if the signing option is set). These addresses are used 
  in the key search.</p>
<p align="left">The handler will search for the corresponding key in each registered 
  key store in turn. If a matching key is found it is returned, otherwise an exception 
  is thrown. </p>
<p align="left">If the key is a secret key then the handler will try each registered 
  pass phrase in turn. If no pass phrase could be found that decodes the secret 
  key data an exception is thrown. The email pipe catches this exception and prompts 
  the user to enter a new pass phrase.</p>
<p align="left">Processing of incoming email is pretty much the exact reverse 
  of the outgoing mail process, except keys are searched for by Key ID and not 
  User ID. Also, a log is attached to the email.</p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="keyhandlers"></a>Key handlers</h4>
<p align="left">Key handlers provide a common API for accessing and querying key 
  stores. This allows the Secure Email Proxy to be extended to obtain keys from 
  diverse key sources, including more exotic sources like HTTP key servers.</p>
<p align="left">Currently, all key sources can either be a file or a server, and 
  extend the classes KeyFile and KeyServer respectively. </p>
